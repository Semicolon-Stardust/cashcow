**4.2.1 Types of Debt**

Debt is a financial obligation that arises when one party borrows money from another with the promise of repaying the borrowed sum, usually with interest, over a specified period. Understanding the various types of debt is crucial for effective debt management and financial planning.

#### 1. **Secured Debt:**
   - *Definition:*
     - Secured debt is backed by collateral, which is an asset that the lender can claim if the borrower defaults on the loan. The collateral serves as security for the lender, reducing the risk of lending.
   - *Examples:*
     - **Mortgages:** Loans used to finance the purchase of real estate. The property itself serves as collateral.
     - **Auto Loans:** Loans used to finance the purchase of a vehicle. The vehicle serves as collateral.

#### 2. **Unsecured Debt:**
   - *Definition:*
     - Unsecured debt does not involve collateral, relying solely on the borrower's creditworthiness. Since there is no specific asset securing the debt, unsecured loans typically have higher interest rates than secured loans.
   - *Examples:*
     - **Credit Cards:** Revolving lines of credit that do not require collateral. The interest rates are typically higher compared to other forms of debt.
     - **Personal Loans:** Loans that individuals can use for various purposes, such as debt consolidation or home improvements, without providing collateral.

#### 3. **Mortgages:**
